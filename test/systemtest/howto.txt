howto do systemtest with ets

-----------------
routing test
focus: basic reception and transmission, correct datatype interpretation
-----------------
preparation:
-build adapter with enabled interfaceTest in main.js

-import test.jnxproj into ets
-setup ip interface etc..
-in diag window replay telegrams systemtest_send.xml
-> adapter mirrors addresses 31/0/* to 31/1/*

assesment: manually compare values, date datatypes might be not be received as sent (ok)
ets seems to have an issue to display dpt23

-----------------
check if values can be read out
-----------------

manually set of one object answer_groupValueResponse": true
restart  adapter
set the object value in iob
in ets, issue Read Value command to trigger GroupValue_read
-> adapter sends the prev. set object value

assesment: manually compare in ets the received value

------------------
autoread
------------------
run adapter without debugger connected
-> adapter issues for all "autoread": true objects a  GroupValue_read on starten

assesment: check for gvr traffic on adapter startup in ets


------------------
trigger groupvalue_read in iob
-------------------
